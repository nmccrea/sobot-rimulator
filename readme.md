### Documentation

Detailed documentation can be found in the [Manual](documentation/Manual.txt).

I also wrote about this project for the Toptal Engineering Blog! Read more about the underlying principles of autonomous mobile robotics [here](https://www.toptal.com/robotics/programming-a-robot-an-introductory-tutorial).


### Requirements

*Sobot Rimulator* is cross-platform compatible. In order to run, the following two items must be installed on your computer:
- Python 2.6.1 or higher
- PyGTK 2.7 or higher

To install Python: The latest Python interpreter can be found at http://www.python.org/download/.

To install PyGTK: The latest PyGTK distributions can found at http://www.pygtk.org/downloads.html.

Alternatively, both pieces of software should be available through package managers such as Apt-Get (for Linux/Unix) or Homebrew (Recommended for Mac)


### To Run

Open a command prompt (terminal) and navigate to the *Sobot Rimulator* directory. Then type:

    python rimulator.py
